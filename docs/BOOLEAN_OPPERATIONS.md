# ![](../img/cad/union32.png)![](../img/cad/subtract32.png)![](../img/cad/intersection32.png)BOOLEAN OPPERATIONS

Boolean operations allow for solids to be used as tools to shape and modify other solids.


# ![](../img/cad/union32.png)UNION
Union allows solids to be combined to create a new solid.

# ![](../img/cad/subtract32.png)SUBTRACT
Subtract allows one solid to be used as a cuttong tool for another sold. Usefull for making hole features.
Selection A will have selection B removed from it.
